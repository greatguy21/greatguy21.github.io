    <td>Well when we ran our code from last week and we found it was not working. It says there was an error on line 54 but it said what was wrong but then we did that and it did not work. We kept on trying and eventually it was was not on that line which was annoying but it showed us the right code which then worked, showing us the congratulations sign when we won.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>As my partner and I had to work on the code from last week this week it took us quite a long time which was very annoying and wasted time, this meant we only briefly started on the true or false section. We also did not get to fully understand the true or false section as we had to rush. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time my partner Kishen and I will be a lot more careful when we put in our code as it wasted so much time on that code instead of carrying on with the true or false or even code further than that. We will thoroughly check through the code to make sure it is always correct and nothing is wrong.
