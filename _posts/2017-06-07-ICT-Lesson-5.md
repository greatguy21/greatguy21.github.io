ICT Lesson 5

Today I thought that we were going to carry on with Code Academy but when we got into the lesson Mr Keen told us to take our chairs into the other room.

Firstly Mr Keen talked about how to make a cup of tea. When he had got the general of making a cup of tea he showed us how much we missed if we wanted to code a robot arm to make the tea. The first step was fill the kettle with water. The robot arm needs to get the kettle, take off the lid, turn the tap on then turn the tap off. It would not just understand fill kettle with water.

He then talked to us about different colours. We see red as red but what if red to us looked like blue to someone else. Then he showed us this article on the blue and black dress or the white and gold dress. It was very confusing as there was about a 50/50 split. Here is the article

This lesson I enjoyed as it had different aspects and it was a break from Code Academy.
