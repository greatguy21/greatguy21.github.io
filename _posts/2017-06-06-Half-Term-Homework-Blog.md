    <td>As I have missed the last two lessons I have had to do a lot at home. Then as the half term homework we had to do 2 hours of work. I started doing it after my exams as I was revising for them. I did the 2 hours in 4 30 minutes sections. I thought this would be the best way. 

The first 30 minutes I found very difficult to understand this was the functions section. I didn't understand much of it and out of the section only completed a tiny bit as I was really struggling.</td>

In the next section I decided to to 1 hour as I thought i would get through more if I did a longer bit. When I was going through I just finished the function section of functions and then moved onto the importing which I worked out how to do after a lot of time. I did finish that bit and a bit more of the functions section before the hour was up.

Then in the last 30 minutes I completed with a struggle the whole functions section. I do not no why I struggled so much on this as I was doing well before this but the functions really confused me and I felt really happy when I had completed the section a bit over the time!</td>

Overall this homework showed me for the first time how hard code academy can get but I was happy completing it and completing the homework set.</td>
