    <td>As I typed last week this week I was the reader this week. I learnt that reading the code is quite hard as you have to be very precise in what you say. My partner was not here as he was ill so I went with another person whose partner was not here so it was fine. We also after we did the correct code we changed the things we could change. This helped us see how simple it was to change the code and still make it work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even though I went with someone else as my partner was not here we did not work as well together. Kiran who was the typer kept looking and the paper instead of just listening to what I said. I did the same at the beginning of the lesson as well. This limited our learning as we worked slower. I still need to work on my typing as I still type too slowly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson will be after Half Term so I have a lot of time to improve. My partner will be back so we will work quicker and faster so that we can get through as much of the booklet as possible. I will also change the blog that I am doing this on to make it look better and finally I will improve my typing by trying to remember vaguely where all the keys are.</td>
