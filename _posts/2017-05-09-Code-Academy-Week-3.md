  <tr>
    <td>As the lesson was cut short for me I had to work really effectively, which I did, because I was cut short on time. My strategy for this lesson was just put my head down and code. If I didn't know the answer I kept trying different solutions until one worked.    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I only had 30 minutes of the lesson because I had a cricket match I sadly did not code as fast and as much as everyone else. This was annoying but I did promise my teacher that I would do extra for homework!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will keep on doing the same techniques as I have been doing before so I would not change that for next time but I will change my focus as I need to focus more.     </td>
