    <td>My painter and I learnt very gradually as we were struggling for most of the lesson but near the end we worked out the correct places to put the wires, resistor and bulbs. Our strategy about keep on trying and try as many different ways that could of worked and finally one of them worked, this was a huge relief.</td>

    <td>The instructions on the booklet were very confusing to my partner and I as there was a picture that was different to the written instructions. This was very annoying as we had to try both which took up double the amount of time and work.  </td>

    <td>Next time as we are now doing the coding with the electrical components I will need to change the way we work as we now have realised that use the pictures and the writing as they are both useful. This will improve both of me and my partner's understanding of fusebox and the booklet.</td>
