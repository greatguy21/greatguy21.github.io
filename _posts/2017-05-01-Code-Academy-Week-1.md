    <td>As it was the first lesson the starting code was very easy and it did not take a long time but then it got into the harder code and it was quite difficult. But if you keep going then even the really hard code is possible to do. The best strategy was just keep going and i you get stuck keep going. </td>

    <td>I need to work on different habits and strategies as when the code gets a lot harder that strategy will not work as well as it is working now. Also as it was the first week I was not use to that type of code so it was quite hard sometimes.   </td>
