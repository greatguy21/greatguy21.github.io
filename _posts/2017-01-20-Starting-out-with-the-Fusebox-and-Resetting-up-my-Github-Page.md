    <td>At first I realised my old github was not working so I had to make a whole new repository and then follow the steps on Google Classroom to help me make a new one. Once I had made a new Github we started using the Fusebox. I learnt how to set up the Fusebox with the monitors and the Fusebox. At first our Fusebox did not work so we had get another one. When we got it working we starting following the booklet. As it was the first lesson it was not too complicated all that the fusebox did was say say hello world in the colour that we liked. Then we saved our work on our memory sticks and then it was the end of the lesson.</td>

    <td>At the start my github blog kept saying there was a page failure and there was a 404 error and I did not no what was wrong so it was quite difficult to work out what it was. Also our monitor and Fusebox was not connecting so we had to look at the wires and see if we needed to push it in further and we did. With the Fusebox there was no problems which was good.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will improve by making sure all the coding is correct on all of the Barry Clark (Github) files and that next time it will be easier. I will also check thoroughly through all the details when doing and setting up the Fusebox. </td>
