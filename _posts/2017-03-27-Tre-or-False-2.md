We finished the True or false section with a bit of time to go sso we a very quick look at what we are going to do next lesson which is with electrical components. This looked quite challenging and will be a challenge to do next week.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My partner was not here again which was very annoying, but I worked with someone whose partner was not here as well. This limited both of our learnings as we had to tell each other our techniques so that we went quicker. My partner for this lesson told me a habit that you ca put capital letters in speech marks as it does not affect the code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even though I thought that I had improved my typing, Kiran who was my partner today was very good at typing so I will need to improve even more. Next time I still need to be fully concentrated all of the time as in some parts of the lesson I just look around or look at another group this is bad as I will not do as much work as others.</td>
