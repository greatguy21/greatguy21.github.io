This was our first lesson of the year with Mr Keen. He showed us this website called repl.it. It was a coding website that let you do any code you want and it will draw it for you. In are first experience of Repl.it Mr Keen showed us how to draw any regular shape. All you had to do was say draw.shape then put the number of sides you want after in brackets. The advancement was that we can make more shapes go on top of each other. This was very tricky and I did not know what to do but when I got some help I worked it out and for homework you had to make a cool design which I did. This was a very successful first lesson.
