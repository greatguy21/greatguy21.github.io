In our final lesson of the year with Mr Tansley he showed us a very similar way of coding than before. He showed us Binary and how to put it into Google sheets. This was very easy as it was the same technique as the week before. I coded it so when you typed a word or sentence it would come up in binary with 1s and 0s. I improved my way of coding from the week before as I did not need to put each letter in a different cell I could just put it in one cell and it would code it for me.
