    <td>The booklet is a very detailed guide for Fusebox and it helps a lot. I looked at all of the coding carefully trying not to miss and semi-colon or a speech mark. When I was looking at the booklet as I had no partner I was talking to Kiran whose partner was not here as well. We helped each other by if someone was confused or did not know what to do we would help. This was very effective.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the beginning of the lesson I realised my partner was not here so I knew the lesson would be a bit tougher. I was working slower as I had to control the Fusebox and look at the booklet and code what it said. I did do a lot of work but I could have done a lot more. I do need to be more careful when I type in the code as a lot of the time I had to go back and look where I made the mistake from copying from the booklet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will start to try and work quicker as I did not use my time effectively all the time. I need to learn how to set up the Fusebox quicker and better because I had to ask one of my friends to help. This took too long and was not time effective. I will also change how I work as I don't think that my way of working I very efficient as some other people.</td>
