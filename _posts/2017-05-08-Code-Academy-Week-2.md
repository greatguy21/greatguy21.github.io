    <td>In the last twenty minutes I was struggling on one part of the code academy code. In the end as I kept trying different ways that I thought would work eventually was successful and in the end I was very happy. This shows that I was persistent on one thing and eventually it paid off.</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will keep working hard and concentrating well as it worked this lesson. But I will try different techniques that could work by maybe reading more carefully so I will hopefully get the code first time everytime and if it doesn't work I will go back to being persistent. </td>
