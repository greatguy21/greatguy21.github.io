    <td>My partner was back again for this lesson so it was a lot easier to work quicker and harder. My partner was the reader for this lesson, so he was telling me what to put on the fusebox and I was the scribe typing everything down. This was a very effective strategy as we got through a whole section of the booklet and it was quite complex at the end.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even though my partner was here in this lesson he was feeling a bit ill so quite a lot of the time I had to check what he was telling me to make sure he told me if there was a capital letter, a semicolon, a speech mark or a space. This was quite frustrating but it did to limit how much work we did. As I was the scribe for this lesson I will be the reader soo I need to make sure that I do a good job and be careful on what i say.</td>

    <td>I will make sure I concentrate 100% as some of the time I am looking at what other groups are doing, talking to them about what I or they are doing or even just talking to them. This definitely holds me back as if I was not talking I could do more work and so could they. I will change that but I could also improve on my typing as sometimes it can be very bad.</td>
