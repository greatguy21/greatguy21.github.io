At the start of the lesson Mr Tansley put up a random two coded words on the board. He told us to try and decode it, I did it pretty quickly. The code was the letter on the board was one more in the alphabet them what the actual word was. The actual word was Hello World but at first it was all jumbled up. Then he showed us how to put it onto the Google sheet. When we put the code in all you had to do was type in a message and it would code it so you could not read it.
