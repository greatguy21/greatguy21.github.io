In this lesson Mr Tansley showed us how to embed documents on our blog. This means that you can add your Google sheets onto the blog. You can see this on my previous blog as I could not upload until this week so I added the Google sheet to that blog to show my progress. To embed the document you had to go into the Google sheet and find the copy URL then you had to go on github and copy it into the post. This is how you embed a document to your blog.
